functionality needed
	fast loading time
	low memory footprint
	offline notes
	compressed audio
	checkboxes
	folder tracking
	snapshot sizing
	search
		EN has its own search facility
			only available online
		specifications are available
			so it could be implemented offline also
		sorting
original main screen buttons
	text note
	ink note
	snapshot
	audio note
	upload file
tech needed
	UI
		HTMLayout
	DTD checking
		only needed for testing
	THTTP
	ENML XML->HTML convertion
		TinyXML
		pugixml
		RapidXML
need to figure out the overall design
	highest level features
		view notes
			subsets of notes
			with sorting
		create notes
			text at first
			photo, ink, audio, files later
		modify todo notes
			by checking/unchecking
		find notes
		switch notebooks
		sync
	required functionality
		UI to view a set of notes
		UI to view a note
		UI to choose a method of note creation
		note creation UI
		note storage and retrieval
		note synchronization
	runtime design
		load main UI first
		delay-load the remaining functionality
		nah, not until profiling shows it to be a bottleneck
	UI design
		log in
			get username and password
			go to the main screen
			action
				OK/Cancel
		main screen
			create notes
			action
				Notes
			menu
				About
				Logout
				Exit
		notes view
			shows most recent notes
			options
				search
				sort
					HTMLayoutSortElements
				reset
			actions
				New note/Sync
		sync
			collapsible
			list sync events
				status
				progress
	data storage design
		store notes and settings
		EN has a flat data model
		so, we can make tables directly from structs
		unsynced notes
			should be stored with the rest
			but marked as asynced
		at sync
			query the database for unsynced notes
			replace them with synced ones received from the server
		full-text search
			provided by the FTS3 extension of SQLite
			used by the Windows EN client
	synchronization design
		sync is comprised of several tasks
			download new server notes
				getSyncState/getSyncChunk/getNoteContent/getResourceData
				resolve conflicts
			upload new local notes
				the server provides replacements for the local notes
				resolve conflicts
		sync connections
			USB always
			9G never
			WiFi probably
		manual sync
			needed for searching server notes
			uploading local notes
			either way, it is only needed in the notes screen
		fault tolerance
			downloading notes
				via SQLite transactions
			uploading notes
				create a log before uploading
				clear it on success
				try to repeat on failure
